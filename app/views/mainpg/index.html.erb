          We provide current information about genetic mutations in the
          <strong><%= @consensus_genes_count.count%></strong> genes known to be associated with cancer.

        This portal is currently in early development.  It is an aggregation of millions of
        identified mutations found from sequencing of more than 500,000 tumours
        identified in the <strong><%=link_to('Cancers Genome Project', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Genome_Project')%></strong>
